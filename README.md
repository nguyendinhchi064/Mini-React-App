# Feature Description (There some lines that are automatic generated by using this code npm create vite@latest todo-app --template react)

# Requirement: npm (Remember to download this)

# Instructions: After you git clone the test, you should type "npm install" to download all the dependancies like styled-components. Then you can rush test with 'npm run dev' to run it in development sever

# React:

Is a Javascript open source library, specialize to decorate UI (User-Interface).

All the features that I very impress about React are:

Component-based: Interface divided into small component, which can be reused and easily to monitor

JSX(JavaScipt XML): React allow developer to write HTML in JavaScipt ????

One-way data binding: Which automate to update UI when the data change???

Virtual DOM: A copy of DOM (Document object model) that help to increase the production rate


To be precise, we can code all html, css in React. Instead of having file css in React, we will have all jsx and js files


# Vite:

Is a build tool that very fit with React, basically it the up-to-date CRA (Create-React-App)

Because this tool has a lot of documents than other tools like Parcel or CRA so I will choose it to build my project. Next.js is also an option but I think that will suit in a big project than this mini test

# Core Knowledge

Hooks(useState and useEffect):

useState use for monitoring the task list and input, when something change the component will automate rendering. In this test, I have applied that into toggle state of the task.

While the Side effects are the actions that should not do in the render and that why we need to use useEffect to handle it. Like calling API, store data in localStorage,... When we store data in localStorage, reloading the page/website won't lost it but when you reloaded the development server, it will lose all data.




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
